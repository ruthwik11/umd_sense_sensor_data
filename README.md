# UMD SENSE Sensor Performance Analysis

## Project Introduction
The purpose of this project is to evaluate the performance of air quality measuring sensors designed by UMD's SENSE. The PM 2.5 measurements taken by the SENSE's sensors will be compared with the corresponding measurements taken by EPA's sensors to evaluate the performance.
